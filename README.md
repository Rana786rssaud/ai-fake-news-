### **Introduction 

In today's digital era, information spreads at an unprecedented rate through social media, news websites, and other online platforms. While this connectivity has many advantages, it also comes with a significant downside â€” the rapid spread of fake news. Fake news refers to misleading or false information presented as legitimate news, often created to manipulate public opinion, deceive readers, or generate sensationalism for profit. The impact of fake news can be severe, influencing elections, spreading panic, promoting hate, and damaging reputations. As a result, detecting and preventing fake news has become a critical challenge.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to combat this growing issue. AI models, especially those based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), can analyze patterns in text and detect deceptive or suspicious content. This project, titled **"AI Fake News Detector"**, is a simple and interactive web-based tool designed to identify potentially fake news articles or headlines using AI principles.

The system uses a basic frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates an AI model by analyzing keywords and sentence structures commonly found in fake news, such as sensational phrases or overly dramatic headlines. While this version uses a mock prediction model for demonstration, it can be integrated with real machine learning models like BERT, RoBERTa, or logistic regression classifiers trained on labeled news datasets for higher accuracy.

This project not only showcases the potential of AI in combating misinformation but also educates users on how technology can assist in verifying news authenticity. It serves as a foundation for building more robust, intelligent systems that empower users to critically evaluate the content they consume online.
